# Stock Price Predictor Frontend

## Introduction

This repository contains the frontend of the Stock Price Predictor application. The application predicts stock prices using a linear regression model. The frontend is built using ReactJS, Lightweight Charts, and Axios, and it interacts with a Flask backend and a machine learning model hosted in a Jupyter notebook.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo [here](https://stonks-by-soham.netlify.app/).

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Lightweight Charts**: A library for creating financial charts.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.

## Performance

Our frontend performs efficiently across devices. You can check the performance metrics [here](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-stonks-by-soham-netlify-app/s56ynutscg?form_factor=desktop).
